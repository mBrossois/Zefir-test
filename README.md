## Setup

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites are Node 14 and Yarn.

We recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing specific version of Node

For instance to install Node 14 you can type:

    $ nvm use lts/fermium

### Running the app in dev mode

To install dependencies:

    $ yarn

to run the Next app locally:

    $ yarn dev

to open the app:

   $ open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

(or open your browser)

### Running the app in production mode
Now has come the time to run your application in production mode!

To do so, first you need to build your Next app:

    $ yarn build

Fix any blocking error you see, then start in production mode:

    $ yarn start

And go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
